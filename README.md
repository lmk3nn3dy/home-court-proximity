In the NCAA March Madness tournament, games are played on neutral courts; however, it is often the case that one team's school is closer in proximity than their opponent's.  Does home-court advantage manifest itself in these scenarios?  Using logistic regression, a probability curve is approximated to estimate a team's chance of winning given their school's proximity to the game location.  An advantage of 100 miles would imply the team's school was 100 miles closer than their opponents while an advantage of -100 would suggest the opposite.
